                                A developer sits in the flow state, mind fully absorbed in solving complex logic problems.
                                Hours pass unnoticed as elegant solutions emerge from intricate algorithms and data structures.
                                Then comes the inevitable interruption: the commit message dialog.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After six hours of deep coding, the cursor blinks mockingly in the Git commit dialog.
                                "What did I even change?" they wonder, staring at the diff that spans 14 files and 200 lines.
                                The deadline looms. The team waits. The mental switch from pure logic to documentation
                                feels like trying to write poetry while solving calculus.
                            </p>

                                This cognitive burden — the constant interruption of deep work to summarize and document —
                                is where our story begins, and where everything changes.

                                "fix stuff", "wip", "updates". "Ok, what was I working on three hours ago? How about two hours ago?"
                                The context has completely evaporated.

                                felt a bit... generic. Back to Slack: "Is there a way to make KodrDriv more personal? The messages

                                Two weeks passed. During the weekly team meeting, their manager Sarah pulled up the Git log
                                and scrolled through the recent commits. "I'm noting that our commit messages are all very
                                detailed lately," she said, looking around the room. "They're professional and comprehensive,
                                but I'm noticing that they all seem like you spent actual time writing them."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                She paused, suppressing a smile. "For example, I see that some of us are still respecting
                                Piratespeak Tuesday?"
                            </p>

                                After the meeting, the team retreated to their private Slack channel — the one without Sarah.
                                "Okay," someone typed, "are we all agreed that switching to KodrDriv was a good idea?"
                                A stream of checkmarks and thumbs-up emojis followed.
                            </p>

                                "The personality configuration was genius," another teammate added. "But speaking of which,

                                The developer looked up from their screen. "How do I even do release notes? I've never
                                written them before."

                                A few days later, back in Slack, the original teammate who had introduced KodrDriv was
                                frustrated: "Ugh, this release has so many bugs. I'm going to be spending all weekend
                                filing GitHub issues to track them all."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The developer looked up, remembering their own learning curve. "You know, you can just
                                send that to the 'review' command in KodrDriv. If your GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable
                                is set correctly, the tool will just look at your review, examine the project, and create
                                a few GitHub issues automatically."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "Wait, what? <code className="inline-code">npx @grunnverk/kodrdriv review</code> does that?"
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "Yeah, just run it and it'll start up your EDITOR and you can send it pages and pages of feedback.
                                After that it'll analyze it and, again, if you have a GITHUB_TOKEN, it'll prompt you to create new issues."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "That seems easy."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "You know, I haven't even told you about the audio-review feature yet. If you run
                                <code className="inline-code">select-audio</code> to choose a microphone, you can just complain to KodrDriv
                                and it'll take care of creating GitHub issues for you."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "Yep. You taught me about commit messages, now I'm teaching you about issue management.
                                Full circle.  Let's stop here, otherwise I'll be telling you about audio-commit."

                                A week later, another developer in the team was venting in Slack: "Every time we update to a new version
                                of an open source project and I want to develop everything end-to-end without rebuilding everything,
                                I end up having to update the package.json with a link or a relative directory. This is getting really old,
                                and I'm inadvertently checking in broken crap to Git."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The now-experienced KodrDriv user jumped in: "Wait, I'm teaching you about KodrDriv again.
                                Just run <code className="inline-code">link</code> and <code className="inline-code">unlink</code>.
                                Configure KodrDriv with some directories for it to scan for package.json files, and you can just link
                                it to anything that's present on the filesystem. THEN when you need to deploy something to production,
                                run <code className="inline-code">unlink</code>."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "Is there an audio version of this one too?"
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "No."

                                The next sprint planning meeting had arrived, and Sarah was looking around the room.
                                "Okay team, we need to decide who's going to be responsible for publishing the next release.
                                It's a complex process — updating dependencies, running tests, creating release notes,
                                managing the PR, waiting for CI, merging, tagging, creating the GitHub release..."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The room fell silent. Everyone knew publishing was tedious and error-prone. Too many steps,
                                too many things that could go wrong, too much manual coordination required.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Slowly, one hand raised. It was the developer who had become the team's unofficial KodrDriv expert.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Sarah looked over with a knowing smile. "Let me guess — you have a way to automate this too?"
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The developer grinned. "Well..."
