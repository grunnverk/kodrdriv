# KodrDriv

KodrDriv is a powerful utility designed to automatically generate intelligent release notes and commit messages from your Git repository. It analyzes commit history, pull requests, and related metadata to create comprehensive, well-structured documentation of your project's evolution. By leveraging advanced AI-powered analysis, it helps teams maintain clear visibility into their codebase's development history while reducing the manual effort typically required for changelog maintenance.

## What is KodrDriv?

KodrDriv is an AI-powered Git workflow automation tool designed to solve the common problem of writing meaningful commit messages and release notes. It provides a unified way to:

- **Generate intelligent commit messages** from your code changes
- **Create comprehensive release notes** automatically from Git history
- **Automate the entire release process** with pull request and GitHub integration
- **Manage workspace dependencies** for monorepo and multi-package development
- **Maintain consistent documentation** with minimal manual effort

## Why KodrDriv?

Writing good commit messages and release notes is time-consuming and often done when you're least in the mood for reflection. **KodrDriv was created specifically to solve the "context switch" problem that happens when you've been deep in code and Git asks you to summarize what you've done.**

Without KodrDriv, you need to manually:
- Stop your flow to write commit messages
- Remember all the changes you made across multiple files
- Craft meaningful release notes from scattered commit messages
- Coordinate complex release workflows with multiple steps

KodrDriv reads your code changes and Git history to automatically generate contextual, meaningful documentation that reflects your actual work.

## Installation

Install KodrDriv globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g @grunnverk/kodrdriv
```

This will make the `kodrdriv` command available globally on your system.

## Quick Start

Here's how to get started with KodrDriv:

### Generate a Commit Message

```bash
# Make some changes to your code
git add .
kodrdriv commit
```

### Generate Release Notes

```bash
# Generate release notes from your recent changes
kodrdriv release
```

### Automate Your Release Process

```bash
# Fully automated release with dependency updates, PR creation, and GitHub release
kodrdriv publish
```

### Link Local Packages for Development

```bash
# Automatically link workspace packages for local development
kodrdriv link --scope-roots '{"@company": "../"}'
```

## Key Features

### AI-Powered Analysis
Uses OpenAI models to understand your code changes and generate contextual commit messages and release notes.

### GitHub Issues Integration
Automatically fetches and analyzes recently closed GitHub issues to provide context for commit messages, especially for large commits addressing multiple features or bugs. Prioritizes issues from current release milestones.

### Comprehensive Release Automation
The `publish` command handles dependency updates, version bumping, PR creation, status checks, merging, and GitHub releases.

### Intelligent Workspace Management
Automatically discovers and links related packages in monorepos and multi-package projects.

### Flexible Configuration
Supports hierarchical configuration with command-line overrides, config files, and environment variables.

### Custom Instructions
Extend or replace default AI instructions to match your project's specific conventions and requirements.

- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Required for publish command and GitHub operations
- `EDITOR`: Your preferred text editor for interactive workflows (optional, defaults to `vi`)

### Setting the EDITOR Variable

For review workflows and issue editing, KodrDriv uses your system's default text editor. You can configure this by setting the `EDITOR` environment variable:

**For vi/vim users:**
```bash
export EDITOR=vi
# Or for vim
export EDITOR=vim
```

**For emacs users:**
```bash

## About the Name

Like Thor's hammer, this tool smashes through your repetitive coding tasks. But unlike Mjölnir, it won't make you worthy — it'll just make you faster. Strike through commits, forge releases, and channel the lightning of AI to automate your workflow. Because sometimes you need a hammer, and sometimes you need a tool that actually works. Pirate.
