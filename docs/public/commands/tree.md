# Tree Command

Analyze dependency order and execute commands across multiple packages in a workspace:

```bash
# Execute custom commands
kodrdriv tree --cmd "npm install"

# Execute built-in kodrdriv commands
kodrdriv tree commit
kodrdriv tree publish
kodrdriv tree pull
kodrdriv tree updates
kodrdriv tree link
kodrdriv tree unlink
```

The `tree` command is designed for workspace environments where you have multiple packages with interdependencies. It provides two execution modes:

1. **Custom Command Mode**: Execute any shell command across packages (original functionality)
2. **Built-in Command Mode**: Execute kodrdriv commands with proper configuration isolation

The command analyzes your workspace structure, builds a dependency graph, determines the correct order for processing packages, and executes operations in each package in the correct dependency order.

## Execution Modes

### Custom Command Mode
Execute any shell command across all packages:
```bash
kodrdriv tree --cmd "npm install"
kodrdriv tree --cmd "git status"
kodrdriv tree --cmd "npm run build"
```

### Built-in Command Mode
Execute kodrdriv commands with configuration isolation:
```bash
kodrdriv tree commit
kodrdriv tree publish --start-from my-package
kodrdriv tree link --exclude "test-*"
kodrdriv tree unlink --dry-run
```

**Supported Built-in Commands**: `commit`, `publish`, `pull`, `updates`, `link`, `unlink`, `development`, `branches`, `run`, `checkout`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ### Configuration Isolation in Built-in Command Mode
>
> When using built-in commands, tree shells out to separate `kodrdriv` processes for each package. This preserves individual project configurations - each package can have its own `.kodrdriv` configuration, preferences, and context directories. This is crucial for maintaining package-specific settings in multi-project workspaces.

For detailed documentation of built-in commands, see [Tree Built-in Commands](tree-built-in-commands.md).

## What It Does

1. **Package Discovery**: Scans the target directories (current directory by default) for all `package.json` files in subdirectories
2. **Dependency Analysis**: Reads each package's dependencies and identifies local workspace dependencies
3. **Topological Sorting**: Creates a dependency graph and performs topological sorting to determine the correct build order
4. **Command Execution**: Executes the specified command in each package directory in the correct dependency order

## Key Features

- **Multi-Directory Analysis**: Analyze dependencies across multiple directory trees in a single command
- **Circular Dependency Detection**: Identifies and reports circular dependencies between packages
- **Resume Capability**: Can resume from a specific package if a previous run failed
- **Flexible Command Execution**: Execute any shell command across all packages

- **Pattern Exclusion**: Exclude specific packages or directories from processing
- **Dry Run Mode**: Preview the build order and execution plan without making changes

## Command Options

- `[command]`: Built-in kodrdriv command to execute (`commit`, `publish`, `link`, `unlink`, `branches`)
- `--directories [directories...]`: Target directories containing multiple packages (defaults to current directory). Multiple directories can be specified to analyze dependencies across separate directory trees. This option replaces the previous `--directory` option and enables analysis across multiple directory structures.
- `--start-from <startFrom>`: Start execution from the specified package onwards in the dependency order.
  - Skips all packages that come before the specified package in the build order
  - Executes the specified package and all packages that follow it
  - Useful for resuming builds or starting from a specific point in the dependency chain
- `--stop-at <stopAt>`: Stop execution before this package directory name (the specified package will not be executed)
- `--cmd <cmd>`: Shell command to execute in each package directory (e.g., `"npm install"`, `"git status"`)

- `--exclude [excludedPatterns...]`: Patterns to exclude packages from processing. **Note**: These patterns match against directory paths and file paths, not package names from package.json files. Examples: `"**/node_modules/**"`, `"dist/*"`, `"test-*"`, `"packages/legacy"`

> [!NOTE]
> ### Command Priority
>
> If both a built-in command and `--cmd` are specified, the built-in command takes precedence and `--cmd` is ignored.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ### How Exclude Patterns Work
>
> The `--exclude` option uses glob patterns that match against:
> - **Directory paths**: The full path to directories containing package.json files
> - **File paths**: The complete path to package.json files themselves
> - **Relative paths**: Paths relative to your current working directory
>
> **What they DON'T match**: Package names from the `name` field in package.json files
>
> **Examples**:
> - `"**/node_modules/**"` → Excludes any package.json in node_modules directories
> - `"dist/*"` → Excludes package.json files in dist subdirectories
> - `"test-*"` → Excludes package.json files in directories starting with "test-"
> - `"packages/legacy"` → Excludes the specific "legacy" package directory
> - `"**/examples/**"` → Excludes any package.json in examples directories
>
> If you need to exclude based on package names, use path patterns that match where those packages are located in your directory structure.

## Multi-Directory Dependency Analysis

One of the powerful features of the `tree` command is its ability to analyze dependencies across multiple separate directory trees. This is particularly useful in development environments where:

- **Open Source Dependencies**: Your main codebase references open source modules that are maintained in separate directory structures
- **Microservices Architecture**: Different services are stored in separate repositories or directories but share common libraries
- **Monorepo with External Dependencies**: Your monorepo depends on packages that are developed and maintained outside the main repository structure

### Common Multi-Directory Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Main Codebase + Open Source Modules
```
project-root/
├── main-app/           # Your main application
│   ├── api/
│   ├── ui/
│   └── core/
└── oss-modules/        # Open source modules you maintain
    ├── shared-utils/
    ├── auth-lib/
    └── data-models/
```

#### Scenario 2: Separate Client and Shared Libraries
```
workspace/
├── client-apps/        # Frontend applications
│   ├── web-app/
│   ├── mobile-app/
│   └── admin-portal/
└── shared-libs/        # Shared libraries
    ├── ui-components/
    ├── business-logic/
    └── api-client/
```

### Multi-Directory Usage Examples

#### Analyze Dependencies Across Multiple Trees
```bash
kodrdriv tree --directories ./main-app ./oss-modules
```

#### Execute Commands Across All Directory Trees
```bash
kodrdriv tree --directories ./client-apps ./shared-libs --cmd "npm install"
```

#### Build Dependencies in Correct Order Across Trees
```bash
kodrdriv tree --directories ./main-app ./oss-modules --cmd "npm run build"
```

#### Custom Directory Structures
```bash
kodrdriv tree --directories /path/to/workspace /path/to/external-deps /path/to/shared-libs --cmd "npm test"
```

### Benefits of Multi-Directory Analysis

1. **Unified Dependency Resolution**: Resolves dependencies across all specified directories as if they were part of a single workspace
2. **Correct Build Order**: Ensures packages are built in the correct order even when dependencies span multiple directory trees
3. **Simplified Workflow**: Execute commands across your entire development ecosystem with a single command
4. **Cross-Directory Linking**: Identifies when packages in one directory depend on packages in another directory

### Multi-Directory Best Practices

1. **Consistent Naming**: Use consistent package naming across all directories to avoid conflicts
2. **Clear Separation**: Keep different types of packages (applications, libraries, utilities) in separate directories
3. **Documentation**: Document which directories contain which types of packages for team clarity
4. **Version Management**: Consider how package versions are managed across different directory trees

## Usage Examples

### Built-in Command Execution

Execute kodrdriv commands across all packages in dependency order:

```bash
# Commit changes across all packages that need it
kodrdriv tree commit

# Publish all packages in dependency order
kodrdriv tree publish

# Link all workspace packages for development
kodrdriv tree link

# Unlink workspace packages
kodrdriv tree unlink --dry-run
```

### Custom Command Execution

Execute shell commands across all packages in dependency order:

```bash
# Install dependencies in all packages
kodrdriv tree --cmd "npm install"

# Run tests across all packages
kodrdriv tree --cmd "npm test"
```



### Scoped Builds and Resume

If a command fails, resume from the failed package:

```bash
# Scoped builds with start-from
# Example: a depends on b, b depends on c, d is independent

# Start execution from package b onwards (b → a → d in dependency order)
kodrdriv tree --start-from b --cmd "npm run build"

# Combine with stop-at to execute only package b
kodrdriv tree --start-from b --stop-at a --cmd "npm run build"

# Resume built-in commands from a failed package within the scoped subgraph
kodrdriv tree commit --start-from my-package
kodrdriv tree publish --start-from my-package

# Resume custom commands
kodrdriv tree --cmd "npm run test" --start-from my-package
```

### Stop at Specific Package

Stop execution before reaching a specific package (useful for partial operations):

```bash
# Stop before publishing the main application package
kodrdriv tree publish --stop-at main-app

# Run tests only up to a certain package
kodrdriv tree --cmd "npm test" --stop-at integration-tests

# Combine start-from and stop-at for precise range control
kodrdriv tree commit --start-from package-b --stop-at package-d
```

The `--stop-at` option is particularly useful for:
- **Partial deployments**: Stop before certain packages that shouldn't be published yet
- **Testing workflows**: Run tests only up to a specific point in the dependency chain
- **Development isolation**: Work on a subset of packages without affecting the entire workspace
- **Staged releases**: Release packages in controlled batches

### Branch Status Overview

View git branch and status information across all packages:

```bash
# Display branch status table for all packages
kodrdriv tree branches

# Show branch status for specific directories
kodrdriv tree branches --directories ./apps ./packages

# Check branch status with exclusions
kodrdriv tree branches --exclude "temp-*" "test-*"
```

The `branches` command provides a comprehensive overview of:
- **Current branch** for each package
- **Package version** from package.json
- **Git status** (clean, modified, ahead/behind, etc.)
- **Formatted table** for easy scanning across large workspaces

This is especially useful for:
- **Pre-release checks**: Ensure all packages are on the correct branch before publishing
- **Development coordination**: See which packages team members are working on
- **Branch synchronization**: Identify packages that need branch updates or merges
- **Release preparation**: Verify all packages are ready for a coordinated release

### Multiple Custom Directories

Analyze packages across multiple directory trees:

```bash
kodrdriv tree --directories /path/to/main-workspace /path/to/shared-libs --cmd "npm audit"
```

### Exclude Patterns

Skip certain packages from processing:

```bash
kodrdriv tree --cmd "npm run lint" --exclude "test-*" "internal-*"
```

### Dry Run

Preview the execution plan without running commands:

```bash
kodrdriv tree --cmd "npm run build" --dry-run
```

### Display Only

Show dependency order without executing any commands:

```bash
kodrdriv tree
```

## Common Use Cases

### Package Installation
```bash
# Install dependencies in all packages
kodrdriv tree --cmd "npm install"

# Install and build everything
kodrdriv tree --cmd "npm install && npm run build"
```

### Code Quality
```bash
# Run linting across all packages
kodrdriv tree --cmd "npm run lint"

# Run tests in dependency order
kodrdriv tree --cmd "npm test"
```

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Clean all packages
kodrdriv tree --cmd "npm run clean"

# Check git status across packages
kodrdriv tree --cmd "git status"

# Update all packages to latest versions
kodrdriv tree --cmd "npm update"
```

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies and link packages
kodrdriv tree --cmd "npm install"
kodrdriv link

# Build everything after linking
kodrdriv tree --cmd "npm run build"
```



## Error Handling and Recovery

When a command fails in any package, kodrdriv provides comprehensive error information and recovery options:

### Error Summary
At the end of any failure, you'll see a clear error summary:
```
📋 ERROR SUMMARY:
   Project that failed: package-name
   Location: /path/to/package-name
   Position in tree: 3 of 8 packages
   What failed: Command failed: npm run build
```

### Complete Error Information
1. **Error Details**: Shows the full error message including stderr and stdout
2. **Error Summary**: Clear summary showing what failed, where, and position in build order
3. **Recovery Command**: Provides the exact command to resume from the failed package
4. **Context**: Shows which packages completed successfully before the failure

### Recovery Workflow
```bash
# Command fails at package-b
kodrdriv tree --cmd "npm run build"
# Shows error details and summary

# Resume from the failed package
kodrdriv tree --cmd "npm run build" --start-from package-b
```

### Timeout Handling
For publish commands that timeout waiting for PR checks:
- Automatic timeout detection with helpful guidance
- Suggestions for CI/CD setup or using `--sendit` flag
- Recovery options including manual promotion

## Exclusion Patterns

Use glob patterns to exclude packages:

- `"test-*"`: Exclude packages starting with "test-"
- `"**/internal/**"`: Exclude any packages in "internal" directories
- `"dist/*"`: Exclude packages in dist directories
- `"*.temp"`: Exclude packages ending with ".temp"

## Integration with Other Commands

The tree command works well with other kodrdriv commands. With built-in command mode, you can now execute most workflow steps through tree:

```bash
# 1. Pull latest changes across all packages
kodrdriv tree pull

# 2. Install dependencies
kodrdriv tree --cmd "npm install"

# 3. Link workspace packages for development
kodrdriv tree link

# 4. Build all packages
kodrdriv tree --cmd "npm run build"

# 5. Run tests
kodrdriv tree --cmd "npm test"

# 6. Check for dependency updates
kodrdriv tree updates --report

# 7. Update external dependencies
kodrdriv tree updates @riotprompt

# 8. Commit changes across packages that need it
kodrdriv tree commit

# 9. Publish packages in dependency order
kodrdriv tree publish
```

The `tree` command is now the central hub for all dependency-aware operations across your workspace.

## Performance Tips

1. **Exclude Unnecessary Packages**: Use `--exclude` to skip packages that don't need processing
2. **Resume from Failures**: Use `--start-from` instead of restarting from the beginning
3. **Combine Operations**: Use shell operators to combine multiple commands: `"npm install && npm run build"`


## Output Format

The command outputs:
1. **Discovery**: Number of packages found
2. **Build Order**: Numbered list showing dependency order
3. **Execution Progress**: Real-time progress for each package
4. **Success Summary**: Final count of completed packages

Example output:
```
